/**
 * This is a set of Firestore Security Rules for the CalMind application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-generated content,
 * such as focus sessions, monthly summaries, earned rewards, and sound recommendations,
 * is stored in subcollections under that user's specific document. This ensures that
 * users can only ever access their own data, providing strong security and privacy by default.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-specific data is nested hierarchically under `/users/{userId}`. This includes
 * subcollections like `/sessions`, `/monthlySummaries`, `/userRewards`, and `/soundRecommendations`.
 * A top-level `/rewards` collection stores global data that is publicly readable but not publicly writable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Ownership: Access to any document within the `/users/{userId}` tree is
 *   granted only if the requesting user's UID matches the `{userId}` in the path.
 * - No User Enumeration: Listing documents from the top-level `/users` collection is
 *   explicitly disallowed to prevent scraping user profile information.
 * - Read-Only Global Data: The `/rewards` collection is readable by any user, signed in or not,
 *   but all write operations are disabled pending the implementation of an admin-only role system.
 * - Default Secure: Any path not explicitly matched is denied access. All write operations
 *   require authentication and authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The security model relies on path-based authorization, which is a highly performant pattern.
 * For documents within user-specific subcollections (e.g., a Session), a `userId` field is
 * required on the document itself. This allows rules to enforce on write operations that the
 * document's internal `userId` matches the `userId` in the path, ensuring data integrity and
 * preventing a document from being created under the wrong user.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The ruleset separates user-private data (under `/users/{userId}`) from globally public data
 * (`/rewards`). This clear separation allows for simple and highly performant rules for list
 * operations, as private collections can be secured by the path and public collections can be
 * opened up without exposing any private information.
